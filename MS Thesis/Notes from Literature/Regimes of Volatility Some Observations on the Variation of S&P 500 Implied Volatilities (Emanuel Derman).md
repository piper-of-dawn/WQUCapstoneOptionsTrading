An **implied volatility skew** refers to the pattern of how implied volatility (IV) varies across options with the same expiration date but different strike prices. Typically, out-of-the-money (OTM) options, especially puts, have higher implied volatility than at-the-money (ATM) or in-the-money (ITM) options. This creates a skewed volatility curve, where IV is a function of the strike price \( K \):

$$
\text{IV}(K) \neq \text{constant}
$$

The skew often arises due to market perceptions of downside risk and demand for protective options.
An option at the money (atm) would have a lower vola than options in the money (itm) or out the money (otm). Why? So atm an investor is quite calm as chances and risks are offset. So bigger market events could lead to gains but also to losses (the premium). However, if you are itm or otm it is a bit different. A massive market movement could lead to huge losses (itm) or to a higher chance to make gains (otm). In fact, investors itm or otm are more sensible re market movements and, therefore, the IMPLIED volatility of these options is higher. By the way, the main reasons why the implied volatility is used as a stress index in financial markets.

The existence of a volatility smile is basically telling us that the assumptions behind the Black Scholes model do not hold true under all circumstances and underlyings. The volatility smile is the market adjustment to the assumptions made by the model. The main assumptions that the existence of the volatility smile is telling us is not true is that returns are normally distributed and that market participants are risk neutral. In real life the underlyings exhibit fat tails (and skew) and traders are risk averse/seeking. The more convex the smile could be due to either one (or a combination) of these two assumptions changing.

There was an article I read ages ago called “The holes in Back-Scholes” that might be helpful.
