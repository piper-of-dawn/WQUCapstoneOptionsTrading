Vol traders, in general, have a set of metrics or tools that they use to decide what they think is cheap and what they think is expensive. They construct portfolios of options based on their belief in the relative values of the options. So, the metrics themselves drive the trade thesis. Another way of saying that is that a vol trader is agnostic about views on the marketplace. The vol trader doesn't come in the morning with a view about whether SPY is going to go up or gold is going to go down, or what rates are going to do. They're just looking at the relative value of options and constructing portfolios from that.
