The implied volatility in context of Black Scholes model of option pricing is obtained by inverting the Black Scholes formula against the observed market price of that option. The implied volatility refers to the Brownian diffusion coefficient inherent in the Black Scholes theory. \cite{Ayache2024}

\cite{Cohen1996} study the impact of derivatives on the underlying asset markets using the Variance Ratio Tests.  They take the ratio of the variance of the daily log price changes with the variance of the multiday log price changes. The focus of their study is the long term government bonds yields for Germany, US and Japan and the equity price indices for US and Germany. The variance ratio test serves as a powerful tool for examining the momentum and the mean reversion of the volatility and could be instrumental in devising trading strategies in the options market.

The closest paper that studies the relationship between the implied and the realized volatility is \cite{ammann2009implied} for a time period of 1996 to 2006. They use the historical 91-day volatility and a second characteristic: beta, market value, market-to-book ratio, or momentum to construct 5 $\times$ 5 grid of portfolios, i.e. each dimension is divided into 5 quantiles. They discovered high-beta stocks, small stocks, stocks with low market-to-book ratios, and non-momentum have a higher implied volatility after controlling for the historical volatility. Whereas for low beta stocks, small caps, low market-to-book ratio and no momentum stocks, the implied volatility overestimates the realized volatility.  An interesting finding is that they cannot reject the null hypothesis that the implied volatility is an unbiased predictor of the realized volatility.
